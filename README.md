# House-Price-Prediction
To predict housing prices in a city to identify areas where housing is becoming unaffordable.
Used two models that can accurately predict housing prices, linear regression and random forest. The result shows that Romdom forest model with the hyperparameters found through Grid Search significantly outperforms the Linear Regression model in terms of both training and test metrics. 

* Training MAE improved from $23,755 (linear regression) to $12,574 (Random Forest).
* Training RMSE improved from $35,283 (linear regression) to $17,309 (Random Forest).
* Test MAE improved from $25,134 (linear regression) to $18,039 (Random Forest)
* Test RMSE improved from $42,276 (linear regression) to $27,396 (Random Forest)
